<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This behavior allows Internet Explorer 5.0 and up to use the proposed
CSS3 property,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#the-box-width">box-sizing</a>.</p>

<h2>Box Model</h2>

<p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 was the first version of IE for Windows to use the
correct box model according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">CSS
standard</a>. This means that the CSS width property describes the width of the
content of an element (content width). Previously IE treated the width as the outer width
(border width) of the element. This means that if you define the width for an element the size will be
different depending on which browser and version the user is using.</p>

<p>The following relations between the content width and the border width can be
useful to understand the differences.</p>

<pre>
BorderWidth = BorderLeftWidth + PaddingLeft +
   ContentWidth + PaddingRight + BorderRightWidth
</pre>

<p>So if we have an element with <code>10px</code> padding, <code>5px</code>
border and we set the width to <code>100px</code> we will get the following:</p>

<pre>
130px = 5px + 10px + 100px + 10px + 5px
</pre>

<p>But if we are using an old version of IE we would get the width <code>100px</code>.
This is a difference of <code>30px</code>; Enough to destroy the most well designed
user interface.</p>

<p>More information can be found at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-width">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-width</a>.</p>

<p>To make it even more complicated IE6 can behave in both the above mentioned
ways depending on whether the document has a valid doctype declaration. The
following
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnie60/html/cssenhancements.asp?frame=true#cssenhancements_topic2">article
from MSDN</a> covers these issues.</p> 

<h2>Box Sizing</h2>

<p>The first browser that really tackled this problem was Internet Explorer 5.0
for Macintosh. The Mac IE team set out to create a browser to support CSS but they
also realized the need to be able to be compatible with IE for Windows. Their
solution was to introduce a CSS property called <code>box-sizing</code>. This
property can have two different values, <code>border-box</code> and <code>content-box</code>.
When set to <code>border-box</code> the IE for Window box model is used and otherwise
the standard box model is used.</p>

<pre>
selector {
   box-sizing: border-box;
}
</pre>

<p>The Mozilla developers also realized the need for the <code>box-sizing</code>
property but since Mozilla does not add non standard CSS properties that might
conflict with future standards they call the property <code>-moz-box-sizing</code>.</p>

<pre>
selector {
   -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
}
</pre>

<p>Even if the 2 most excellent browsers when it comes to CSS decided to support
the <code>box-sizing</code> property Microsoft decided that a media bar was a
more important feature for IE6 even though the developer community kept asking for
better CSS support.</p>

<h2>The behavior</h2>

<p>Since Microsoft did not want to support the <code>box-sizing</code> property
and more and more pages needs to work in more than one browser I decided to
create a behavior that adds support for both the content box and the border box
models.
The behavior works in IE5 and up for Windows and it allows you to force elements
in IE5 to follow the CSS box model or you can use IE 6 with a valid doctype and
use the border box model.</p>

<pre>
.border-box {
   behavior:        url("boxsizing.htc");
   box-sizing:      border-box;
   -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
}

.content-box {
   behavior:        url("boxsizing.htc");
   box-sizing:      content-box;
   -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
}
</pre>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>The box sizing behavior only works when all lengths are expressed using
the <code>px</code> unit. This is because Internet Explorer has no way to
translate between different units. Percentage values are in theory possible to
support but I've decided to not include these from the beginning. If there is
a demand for percentage values this might be added.</p>

<p>Usage of <code>currentStyle.boxSizing</code> and
<code>runtimeStyle.boxSizing</code> should be prevented. If these are used
and changed outside the behavior file the behavior might behave incorrectly.
The same problems exists with <code>currentStyle.width</code> and
<code>runtimeStyle.width</code> (as well as the same for height).</p>

<p>Changes to global style sheets does not update element sizes. This means that
if the width is changed by changing the rule inside the style sheet the size is
not updated. The size can be updated by removing the behavior and reapply it or
changing the <code>style.boxSizing</code> value.</p>
